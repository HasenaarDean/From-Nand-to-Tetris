~Nand2Tetris Ex5~

~Files submitted~
ExtendAlu.hdl - an extended version of the alu from project 2, featuring multiplication and shifting
Memory.hdl - entire memory unit of the computer, get an address and calculate the output from the address location
CPU.hdl - central processing unit of the hack computer, getting an a/c instruction and can compute output from the 
          alu and updates the AMD registers.
CpuMul.hdl - an extended version of the cpu, featuring two more useful bits in the c instruction, extending the chip 
             to compute from the extended alu
Computer.hdl - a top chip combining all of the hack computer's hardware devices: cpu, ram and rom.

~Remarks~
*In the CPU/CPUMUL part we converted the diagrams from the book to an hdl code with the control bits we got from
 the input instruction itself.
*The extended ALU was the same as the ALU but we computed the multiplication and shift parts and just ~MUXED IT~ in
 the end.
*In the memory chip we checked where the address is located (RAM or I/O devices) and then we just computed the output 
 from all of them and MUXED IT AGAIN.
*In the computer top chip we just translated the diagram from the book the hdl language connecting all the chips from 
 this chapter with the ROM one.
